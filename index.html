  <br>I am a graduate student in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at University of Wisconsin-Madison.
  <br>My research focus is multi-scale control, optimization, scheduling and energy systems.
  <br>I completed my undergraduate education in 2014 with a Bachelor of Technology (Honours) in Chemical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India.
  <br>After completing my undergraduate degree, I worked for a year as Graduate Engineer Trainee at Reliance Industries Limited, Hazira, India.
  <br>For my Ph.D. I am co-advised by <a href="http://zavalab.engr.wisc.edu/">Professor Victor M. Zavala</a> and <a href="http://maravelias.che.wisc.edu/">Professor Christos T. Maravelias.

    <h3>Resiliency Considerations in Biomass to Biofuels Supply Chain Design Optimisation<right>July 2014- Mar 2015</right></h3>
    <h5>
      Research Assistant, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Bombay
    </h5>
	<h5>
      Guide: Prof Yogendra Shastri
    </h5>
    <ul>
    <li>Developed a Deterministic Optimization Model using Mixed Integer Linear Programming in GAMS which provides optimal supply chain network design for  
	lignocellulosic biofuels produced in 13 County region of Southern Illinois, USA.</li> 
	<li>Incorporated the theoretical concept of Regional Biomass Processing Depots (RBPDs) to quantitatively analyse and show their importance in reducing transport 
	costs, acting as efficient storage locations and in turn, mitigating losses incurred due to disruptions in network such as loss of feed due to calamities like floods, drought etc.</li>
    <li>Developed a Stochastic Optimization Model to incorporate disruptions costs accounting for uncertainties in network by adding probable eventualities of the uncertainties in the model.
	The model provides the Optimized Supply Chain Design with quantized efficiency-resiliency trade-offs. Ananlysis shows substantial improvements in reliability can be made with marginal rise 
	in operating cost without decreasing efficiency very much.</li>
	<li>Comparisons made between robustness of supply chains obtained from consideration and non-consideration of expected disruptions shows that substantial improvements in reliability can be 
	made with marginal rise in operating cost without decreasing efficiency very much</li>

     Research Assistant, Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, India
    </h5>
	<h5>
      Guide: Prof Mani Bhushan and Prof Madhu Bellur
    </h5>
    <ul>
    <li>Grouped SPNDs with different dynamic characteristics into smaller clusters of SPNDs with higher correlation coefficients using K-Means Clustering Algorithms in MATLAB.</li>
	<li>Developed models using Principle Component Analysis based on Eigen-Decomposition of Covariance matrix of measurement data of SPNDs in clusters. The models are used for 
    fault detection and diagnosis in defective SPND if any, based on measurement data from other SPNDs in the same clusters.</li>
